Subject: Welcome to Open Collective!

{{> header}}

<h1>Hey {{collective.name}} ðŸ‘‹</h1>

<p>Thank you for applying to have your group hosted by <a href="https://opencollective.com/the-social-change-nest">The Social Change Nest</a> . Your page has been set up, but is not yet live.</p>

<p>The next step is to book a 45 minute onboarding call with us.  Weâ€™ll talk you through getting the page live. Book that in <a href="https://calendly.com/accountableonboarding">here</a>. If none of these times work for you, <a href="mailto:accountable@thesocialchangeagency.org">get in touch</a>.</p>

<p><b>Before this call please make sure you have looked at the <a href="https://thesocialchangeagency.org/nest-supporting-new-movements/fiscal-hosting/">website</a> and read the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zHArRkjHIstk8b_rMDhHGFnKLfWYCeVhLYLWHEEunlY/edit">FAQâ€™s</a>.</b></p>

<p><b>Please keep in mind there are three things we require before we can approve your group:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Add your expense policy to your Open Collective page. This is your agreement on what money collected will be used for.</li>
  <li>Send the names and details of your three (or more) administrators to <a href="mailto:accountable@thesocialchangeagency.org">accountable@thesocialchangeagency.org</a></li>
  <li>Have us verify your group by adding us to your main communication channel </li>
</ol>

<p>Once this has been done, weâ€™ll hit approve and make your page live. You can then start collecting donations and paying expenses.</p>

<p>We look forward to meeting you during onboarding! If you have any questions, please donâ€™t hesitate to get in touch by emailing <a href="mailto:accountable@thesocialchangeagency.org">accountable@thesocialchangeagency.org</a></p>

<p>All the best,</p>

<p>The Social Change Nest.</p>
