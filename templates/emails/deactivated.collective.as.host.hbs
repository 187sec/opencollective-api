<p>Hi,</p>

<p>You have successfully deactivated your host. Your profile will no longer be able to receive and add funds for collectives or receive Bank and PayPal payments. Your profile will no longer have a host dashboard either.</p> 

<p>If you think this was a mistake, please reactivate your host from the settings in your profile or contact <a href="mailto:support@opencollective.com">support@opencollective.com</a></p> 

<p>Thank you!</p>
